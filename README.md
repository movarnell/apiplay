# Simple Weather App

This is a simple, yet practical weather application built as part of my journey to learn API development. The app uses a REST API to retrieve weather information by location from [https://www.weatherapi.com/](https://www.weatherapi.com/), and displays basic weather information for today and tomorrow.

When a user first visits the website, there is a message asking them to search for their location. Then when the API call returns it displays the current weather below. 

## Technologies Used
