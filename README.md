# Simple Weather App

This is a simple, yet practical weather application built as part of my journey to learn API development. The app uses a REST API to retrieve weather information by location from [https://www.weatherapi.com/](https://www.weatherapi.com/), and displays basic weather information for today and tomorrow.

When a user first visits the website, a loading icon is displayed while waiting for the API call to retrieve the user's current location based on their shared location data from the browser. Additionally, users can enter a city name or zipcode to view weather information for their desired location.

## Technologies Used
